Welcome to the Model for Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere (MPAS-A) Contributors Guide! This comprehensive guide is designed to help you contribute effectively to the MPAS-A codebase, whether you're adding new physics schemes, modifying the dynamical core, or integrating new analysis tools.

## What is MPAS-A?

The Model for Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere (MPAS-A) is a non-hydrostatic atmosphere model and a key component within the broader MPAS family of Earth-system models. All MPAS models share a common characteristic: they utilize centroidal Voronoi tessellations for their horizontal meshes, which underpins the development of a shared software framework.
